## üêõ Bug Fixes & Updates

### View Solution Button Fix (Post-Launch)
**Issue**: The "View Solution" button in the flashcard review interface was not functioning due to state management mismatch.

**Root Cause**: Architecture mismatch between components:
- `FlashcardReview` component had local `showSolution` state
- `SolutionModal` was rendered in `App` component with separate state
- Button click updated wrong state, so modal never appeared

**Solution Applied**: 
- ‚úÖ Added `onShowSolution` prop to `FlashcardReview` interface
- ‚úÖ Removed local `showSolution` state from `FlashcardReview`
- ‚úÖ Created `handleShowSolution` function in `App` component
- ‚úÖ Connected button click to proper state management
- ‚úÖ Verified build and functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/flashcards/FlashcardReview.tsx` - Updated interface and button handler
- `src/App.tsx` - Added solution modal state management

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - View Solution button now properly opens the solution modal with syntax-highlighted code display.

### Voice Recording & Timer Reset Fixes (Post-Launch Issue #2)

**Issue 1**: Voice recording not working - no text appearing when user speaks, and not auto-stopping when user stops speaking.

**Root Cause**: 
- `useSpeechRecognition` was set to `continuous: false`, causing recognition to stop after first pause
- No interim results being passed to update the text area in real-time
- User had to manually stop recording instead of auto-stop after silence

**Issue 2**: Timer not auto-resetting to 5 minutes when user goes to next question.

**Root Cause**: 
- Timer component only resets when `duration` or `autoStart` props change
- Since `settings.timer_duration` stays the same between cards, Timer never resets
- No mechanism to trigger reset on card change

**Solutions Applied**:

**Voice Recording Fixes**:
- ‚úÖ Changed `continuous: false` to `continuous: true` for better real-time recognition  
- ‚úÖ Added `onInterim` prop to VoiceRecorder component
- ‚úÖ Added `handleVoiceInterim` function to update text area with interim results
- ‚úÖ Added `useEffect` in VoiceRecorder to call `onInterim` when transcript changes
- ‚úÖ Connected interim results to FlashcardReview for real-time text updates
- ‚úÖ Enhanced auto-stop with 30-second default timeout

**Timer Reset Fix**:
- ‚úÖ Added `key={currentIndex}` prop to Timer component
- ‚úÖ Forces Timer to re-mount (and thus reset) when moving to next card
- ‚úÖ Timer now properly resets to full duration on each new flashcard

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/common/VoiceRecorder.tsx` - Enhanced voice recognition with interim results
- `src/components/flashcards/FlashcardReview.tsx` - Added interim handler and timer key
- `src/hooks/useSpeechRecognition.ts` - Already had proper continuous support

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** 
- Voice recording now shows real-time text updates as user speaks
- Voice automatically stops after silence or timeout
- Timer properly resets to 5 minutes (or configured duration) on each new card
